# CS360-Weight-Tracker-Project
# Mobile App Development Journal 

## Overview  
This project involved developing a fully functional **Weight-Tracking App**, designed to help users monitor and record their daily weight progress. The main goal was to create a simple, user-friendly interface that encourages consistency and motivation in personal health tracking. The app addressed user needs such as easy data entry, progress visualization, and responsive feedback to keep users engaged and informed about their fitness goals.

## User-Centered Design and UI  
To meet user needs, the app included essential screens such as a **Login Screen**, **Weight Entry Screen**, and a **Progress Overview Screen**. These interfaces were designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, ensuring users could quickly log information and view updates. My UI designs emphasized intuitive navigation, minimal text input, and consistent color themes to create a comfortable and seamless user experience. By focusing on accessibility and ease of use, the design kept users in mind and reduced potential frustration—making the app feel approachable for beginners.

## Coding Process and Strategies  
During development, I used a **modular approach**, building and testing each feature in stages before integrating them together. I structured the code for readability and maintainability by organizing functionality into clear methods and ensuring proper variable naming conventions. I also used **emulator testing** to verify screen transitions and input handling as I coded. These strategies helped prevent major integration issues and will be useful in future projects, especially when I begin developing **game and study tool apps** to support learning for my son.

## Testing and Validation  
Testing was a continuous process throughout development. I verified the app’s functionality through both **manual input tests** and **emulator testing** to check screen navigation, data persistence, and UI responsiveness. Testing ensured that each feature worked correctly and that the app remained stable across different Android configurations. This process was critical—it revealed minor logic errors and UI alignment issues early, allowing me to refine the app before final submission.

## Innovation and Challenges  
One challenge I faced was organizing the flow between multiple screens while maintaining consistent design and state management. To overcome this, I focused on clear data handling and structured navigation to keep the app intuitive. I also refined UI layouts using **Figma** prototypes before coding, which helped me visualize the user journey and reduce confusion in the final design.

## Demonstration of Skills  
I was particularly successful in **creating a cohesive, user-centered experience** that tied together design, functionality, and usability. This project demonstrated my growing skills in Android development, UI/UX design, and code organization. It also reflected my ability to manage a full development cycle—from concept to deployment-ready product—while keeping the user experience as the central focus.
